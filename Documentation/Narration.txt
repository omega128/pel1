Can you hear me up there? We've got the rest of the house covered, so the attic is /all yours/

The old lady had a lot of stuff packed before she kicked the bucket. Don't worry about the big furniture, just focus on getting what you can lift, and drop it down below. According to the granddaughter there's supposed to be a safe up there somewhere, full of real expensive jewelry gathered from the farthest reaches of the world, pieces that meant more to the old bat than the air she breathed. If we can find /that/, we'll make a mint.

Oh, and about the ghost. I went over the place earlier with a meter. There's definitely someone dead up there. Not much energy, maybe a class two, three. Barely a poltergeist, really.

I don't think we'll need to break out the full exorcism treatment, just get everything down below as quickly as you can. Whoever is up there seems quiscient, not likely to cause any problems unless, say, someone goes up to steal everything that mattered to them in life and then sell it at a massive estate sale at the behest of their ungrateful grandchildren.

That's all for now.

Let us know when you're done. -Spooky out!
